## Assembly and SNP calling benchmarking based on HCMV mock communities

This repository contains the scripts and pipeline which can reproduce the results in HCMV benchmarking paper. In this study we evaluated the genome assemblers and variants callers on 6 HCMV mock communities in which each consists of two lab strains. 

### Prerequirements

To reproduce the output, the following tools with specified version need to be installed:

1. `Snakemake` (v5.3.0) for excuting the pipeline.
2. `R-3.5.1` and package `tidyverse`, `SomaticSignatures`, `MutationalPatterns` and `cowplot` for the visualization and mutation signature analysis.
3. `fastp` (v0.19.4), `BWA MEM` (v0.7.17), `SAMtools` (v1.8), `mummer` (v3.23), `picard` (v2.18.2), `csvtk` (v0.17.0).
4. `BCFtools` (v1.8), `VarScan` (v2.4.3), `Freebayes` (v1.2.0), `LoFreq` (v2.1.3.1).
5. `ABySS` (v2.1.4), `megahit` (v1.1.3) , `IDBA` (v1.1.3), `SPAdes` (v3.12.0), `Ray` (v2.3.1), `tadpole` (v37.99).
6. `metaquast` (v5.0.2) was used for evaluate the assembles.
7. `PEAR` (v0.9.6), `savage` (v0.4.0) for haplotype assembly. `Python` (v2.7) is required by `savage`.



First of all, the `bioconda` must be install in your system. You can follow this instruction [here](https://bioconda.github.io). Then, you simply install all tools using:

```shell
conda env create -f config/conda_environment.yaml
```

The above command line will create a conda environment named **hcmv_benchmark** and install all required tools listed above into this environment except for `savage`.

Since `savage` requires `Python` version 2.7, you need to create a distinct environment for it:

```shell
conda create -n savage savage=0.4.0 PEAR=0.9.6
```

Install `R` and `Python` packages:

```shell
# Activate environment
conda activate hcmv_benchmark
# Install Python packages via pip
pip install pandas
# Install R packages 
Rscript -e 'install.packages(c("tidyverse", "cowplot", "pheatmap", "VennDiagram", "gridExtra", "reshape2", "NMF", "ggdendro", "RColorBrewer"))'
```

To Install `R Bioconductor` packages `SomaticSignatures`, `MutationalPatterns` , we should type `R` to enter the `R` command window. In the `R`command window, you need to install core packages for `Bioconductor`:

```R
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install()
```

Then, the `SomaticSignatures`, `MutationalPatterns` can be installed by:

```R
BiocManager::install(c("SomaticSignatures", "MutationalPatterns", "SomaticCancerAlterations"))
```



After all those have been done, please download the pipeline into your system:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:hzi-bifo/HCMV_benchmark.git
```

### Download the dataset and reference genomes
All the sequencing data can be obtained from ENV with accession number: PRJEB32127. And the genome sequences of HCMV strains and Phix are included in this repo.
```shell
# Download the sequencing data
```


### Preapre the configuration file and sample list file

- Modify the `config/config.yaml`
All the paths must be either relative path to the parent directory of `config` folder or absolute path.

```yaml
samplesDesc: config/sample.path.tsv
MerlinRef: ../ref/merlin/Merlin.BAC.fasta # path to Merlin genome
TB40ERef: ../ref/TB40/TB40E.GFP.fasta # path to TB40 genome
AD169Ref: ../ref/AD169/AD169.BAC.fasta # path to Ad169 genome
PhixRef: ref/Phix.fa # path to the phix genome, to remove remaining phix sequences
projectPath: ~/hcmv_benchmark_output # path to the project aka the directory for the outputs

genomeDiffM: merlin_TB40E
genomeDiffA: AD169_TB40E

```

- Obtain the `CLC` SNP calling results from this repo 
`CLC` is not a freeware, so here we provide the output SNPs in this repo. First you need to create a project folder, for example with name `hcmv_benchmark_output` and then copy the files into the project directory:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/hcmv_benchmark_output/results/snp/callers/clc/
# put the CLC SNP calling results in the corresponding folder
cp -r HCMV_benchmark/data/clc ~/hcmv_benchmark_output/results/snp/callers/clc/
```

### Evaluate the assembly and haplotype reconstruction


### Test the SNP callers
To include the CLC result in the evaluation, please put the CLC variants calling results provided in this repo into your project directory:
```shell
mkdir -p <your project path>/results/SNP/callers
cp -r HCMV_benchmark/data/CLC <your project path>/results/SNP/callers
```

### Analyze the mutation context of identified SNPs


### All in one:
```shell
python run_all_benchmakring.py
```
